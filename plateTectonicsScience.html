<h2>Background Information of Seismic Event</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The seismic event occurred in Validva, Chile</li>
    <li>The earthquake was rated a magnitude of 9.5</li>
    <li>The event occured at 3:11PM on May the 22ND 1960 UTC </li>
    <li>It was named after the city that it affected the most</li>
</ul>

<h2>Short Term Effects</h2>
<ul>
    <li>There was a tsunami that came after the earthquake</li>
    <li>There were some landslides that came after it too</li>
    <li>Lots of people were scattered around and were lost</li>
    <li>A tsunami hit the shore of hawaii about 15 hours after the earthquake</li>
    <li>The earthquake also destroyed all the houses near and at Validiva</li>
    <li>The earthquake also killed 1665 people</li>
</ul>

<h2>Long term effects</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The earthquake was so large that it cause landslides which changed the course of rivers completely</li>
    <li>The economy was destroyed as they had to spend millions of dollars to repair roads and buildings</li>
    <li>There was also a starvation since all the crops and such were destroyed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lessons people learned for the future</h2>
<ul>
    <li>They created strict building rules so that when it happens again it won't destroy everything.</li>
    <li>They now have faster information relays to other people as they didn’t send tsunami warnings fast
        enough during the 1960’th earthquake</li>
    <li>They are now very familiar with what to act when an earthquake happens so that they don’t lose as many
        people as before</li>
    <li>There are machines called seismograms that measure earthquakes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Connections for plate tectonics</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The NAZCA plate and the SOUTH AMERICAN plate collided with each other a long time ago and when 1960 hit
        the NAZCA plate fell under releasing the tension that the two plates had against each other creating
        ripples of seismic waves through the earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Connection <i id="to" onmouseover="twoonhover()" onmouseout="twofunctionleave()">2</i> British Columbia</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We are on the edge of the North American Plate that is currently colliding with the Juan de Fuca plate.
        (We are in a subduction zone)</li>
    <li>The last big earthquake in British Columbia was in 1700 and was called “The megathrust”</li>
    <li>The next earthquake, as scientists named it, was called “The Cascadia.”</li>
    <li>There is a big earthquake that is predicted that will happens soon on the Cascadia Subduction Zone</li>
</ul>
