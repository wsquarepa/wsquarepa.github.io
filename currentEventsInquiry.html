<h1>Welcome to my Current Events Inquiry project!</h1>
This website is accessable to you all. <br>
Welp, that put aside, let's get into it! <br>

<h3>1: To make a vaccine, they use a weakened or dead version of the virus.</h3>
<p>
    The reason why they do that is because if they put a live virus into your body you will surely be infected as
    when they put a weakened version of the virus into your body your body will get used to the virus and learn how to
    defend against it when it gets attacked by it.
</p>
<h3>2: The vaccine tricks your body into thinking that it's under attack.</h3>
<p>
    That works because then your body will attack the virus and as stated above, will learn the strengths and weaknesses
    of the virus and will be able to protect against it next time.
</p>
<h3>
    3: Most of the time, vaccines are usually a one time thing, but for some viruses, including the tinnitus virus,
    will need a "boost" to continue protection against it.
</h3>
<p>
    The reason is because your body may forget how to fight off the virus and it'll result in getting you infected.
</p>
<h3>4: If the real virus enters your body, your white blood cells will react faster than if you didn't 
    have the vaccine.</h3>
<p>
    Muscle memory!
</p>
<h3>5: There are 5 different types of vaccines.</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Live Vaccines
        <ul>
           <li>
               They are weakened versions of the real virus, as they are the most effective as they are the closest 
               to the real virus.
            </li> 
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Dead Virus Vaccines
        <ul>
            <li>
                They are dead versions of the virus, but they still do attack the immune system but 
                just don't replicate.
            </li>
            <li>
                They will require multiple shots as they aren't as effective as the normal Live viruses.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Toxoid Vaccines
        <ul>
            <li>
                They prevent viruses that act like poison. In the process of creating this vaccine, 
                they create a weakened version of the virus that won't cause illness.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        SubUnit Vaccines
        <ul>
            <li>
                They only contain parts of the actual virus, so they don't usually cause 
                many side effects. (Hence the name SubUnit)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Conjugate vaccines
        <ul>
            <li>
                They fight the viruses that have a sugar-like coating around the virus, 
                which usually young children's immune system isn't fast enough to fight the virus.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>6: Covid-19 is actually very similar to the flu (Influenza)</h3>
<p>
    This is because Covid-19 has the same symptoms as the flu: Coughing, difficulty in breathing and headaches.
</p>
<h3>7: A vaccine is more important than a cure.</h3>
<p>
    Why? That's because as when you get vaccinated you receive immunity to the virus and it's also
    developed faster than a cure.
</p>
